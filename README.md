### \| IMDB Data Analysis :movie_camera:
This project was to find out what factors had high correlation to the **gross**. In conclusion, the **budget** has a high correlation (> 0.7). 
First, the project used matplotlib to plot the scatter dots of gross and budget. From there, we can see when budget increases, the gross increases relatively.

Secondly, in order to visualize their relation better. Regression line was drawn to indicate the positive correlation.

Third, Heatmap was used to show the numbers of correlation.

Lastly, The correlations were sorted ascendantly.

### \| Bike Buyers Excel Dashboard ðŸš²
In order to find out what traits of the survey takers would be more likely to respond to the survey, a dashboard was created to answer the question. After analyzing, people with age between 31 to 55 are the major survey respondents. Besides, the dashboard also reflected the relationship between income and education level. Such information can be used by the business to make selling strategies targeted at specific age groups with certain education level.

### \| Covid-19 Data Analysis in R Language ðŸ¦ 
Determining what factors were statistically significantly related to death was the main goal of this analysis. However, the original raw data was not ready to be used as some columns format were not standardized, which means they needed to be cleaned up first. Next step, in order to find out the factors mentioned, both age and gender were hypothesized to be related to death. Finally, after performing Welch's Two Sample t-test, the p-values of those were less than 0.05, meaning we can reject the null hypothesis, concluding that both age and gender are statistically significant.<br />
