### Introduction :star:
This is a brief introduction. Feel free to jump to the sections you like by clicking the titles under the Table of Content, whose order is ranked by the date the projects were added to the portfolio. Each section contains the title, the goals of the project, and the steps that I took to achieve the results. The source code (if it was written in Python rather than data visualizations in Power BI) can be found in the same repository with the same name. Thanks for reading!

### Movies.ipynb :movie_camera:
This project was to find out what factors had high correlation to the **gross**. In conclusion, the **budget** has a high correlation (> 0.7). 
First, the project used matplotlib to plot the scatter dots of gross and budget. From there, we can see when budget increases, the gross increases relatively.
