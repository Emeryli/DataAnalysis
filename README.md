### \| Bike Buyers Excel Dashboard ðŸš²
In order to find out what traits of the survey takers would be more likely to respond to the survey, a dashboard was created to answer the question. After analyzing, people with age between 31 to 55 are the major survey respondents. Besides, the dashboard also reflected the relationship between income and education level. Such information can be used by the business to make selling strategies targeted at specific age groups with certain education level.
